# Lerobot 3D

A 3D-grounded SO101 teleoperation stack: multiple RealSense cameras fused into one live scene point cloud, the robot's own URDF tracked alongside it via forward kinematics, and camera-to-robot calibration solved with ICP against that same mesh — all driven from one browser session via [viser](https://viser.studio/).

- **Teleop** — N SO101 leader→follower pairs, one or more RealSense cameras fused into a single scene point cloud per frame, config-driven (`teleop_config.yaml`), no code changes needed.
- **3D viewer** — a viser browser UI rendering the fused scene, the full robot point cloud, and a per-link breakdown, all updating live, plus GUI buttons for capture/save-subgoal/quit.
- **Calibration** — camera extrinsics solved by manually aligning a masked robot point cloud onto the robot's own URDF mesh, then refined with multi-scale ICP; intrinsics and robot arm motor calibration are handled alongside.
- **Extensible** — a small Python API (`TeleopSystemConfig`, `TeleopPointCloudSystem`, `SystemStateViewer`) for building custom capture/recording scripts on top.

## Why `Lerobot 3D`?

Robots operate in 3D, but most accessible robot learning and teleoperation pipelines still primarily operate on 2D camera observations. For many tasks, we care about the geometry of the scene relative to the robot: where objects are, what is reachable, what is occluded, and where collisions may occur.

`lerobot_3d` makes this 3D grounding a first-class part of the LeRobot stack. It aligns multiple depth cameras with the robot, fuses their observations into a shared 3D point cloud, and tracks the robot's URDF geometry in the same coordinate frame. The goal is to provide a simple, reusable foundation for 3D-aware robot learning instead of rebuilding camera calibration and 3D visualization infrastructure for every project.


## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[realsense]"
```

(`realsense` pulls in `pyrealsense2`, required to stream RealSense cameras.)

## Teleop (`lerobot-teleop`)

Drives **N SO101 follower** arms from **N SO101 leader** teleoperators while streaming **one or more Intel RealSense** cameras, fusing depth into a scene point cloud, sampling the first follower's URDF for a robot point cloud, and rendering all of it live in **viser**.

```bash
lerobot-teleop
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--config PATH` | Teleop config YAML (see below). Omit to use the default `teleop_config.yaml`. |
| `--hz 60` | Main loop rate in Hz (default `60`). Use `0` or negative for no pacing. |

Everything else — recording, extrinsics path, RealSense serials, camera resolution/FPS, the tune panel, the viser port — lives in `teleop_config.yaml`, not on the command line. Run `lerobot-teleop -h` for the full flag list.

Open `http://localhost:<viser_port>` (default `8080`) in a browser to see the fused scene point cloud, the full robot point cloud, and a per-link robot point cloud per URDF link, all updating live. With `tune: true` in the config, the same page shows **Quit** / **Capture** / **Save subgoal** buttons — Quit stops the main loop cleanly, Capture snapshots calibration images (see [Performing calibration](#performing-calibration)), Save subgoal writes the current fused scene to `subgoals/`.

## Teleop configuration

Everything — hardware wiring **and** run settings — lives in **`teleop_config.yaml`**, not in Python. A dev-checkout copy ships at `src/teleop_config.yaml`:

```yaml
leaders:
  - port: /dev/ttyACM0
    id: bender_leader_arm
followers:
  - port: /dev/ttyACM3
    id: bender_follower_arm
realsense_serials:
  - "244622072067"

extrinsic_json: extrinsic_calibration.json
recording_name: ""
tune: true
camera_width: 848
camera_height: 480
camera_fps: 60
viser_port: 8080
```

`leaders`/`followers` must be the same length (matched by list position); `realsense_serials` needs at least one entry. See `src/teleop_config.yaml` for the full, annotated field list (recording, URDF/calibration overrides, camera stream, smoothing) and `lerobot_3d.teleop_config.TeleopSystemConfig` for the underlying dataclass.

**Resolution order** for both `teleop_config.yaml` and the extrinsics JSON: an environment variable (`LEROBOT_3D_TELEOP_CONFIG` / `LEROBOT_3D_EXTRINSIC_JSON`) → the current working directory → `src/<file>` next to the installed package (dev checkout).

## Performing calibration

</p>

**Robot arm motor calibration** (homing/joint limits) is handled by LeRobot itself, not this repo — run `lerobot-calibrate` for each leader/follower arm. Point `teleop_config.yaml`'s `robot_calibration_dir` / `robot_calibration_ids` / `robot_calibration_paths` at the resulting JSON if it isn't in LeRobot's default location.

**Camera intrinsics** are written automatically to `intrinsic_calibration.json` when `lerobot-teleop` shuts down and that file doesn't already exist.

**Camera extrinsics** (each RealSense's pose relative to the robot base) are the main calibration workflow:

1. **New camera, no existing entry?** Bootstrap `extrinsic_calibration.json` with an identity transform for its serial:
   ```json
   {
     "YOUR_SERIAL": {
       "X_WC": [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]
     }
   }
   ```
2. Run `lerobot-teleop`, position the robot arm in view of the camera(s) you're calibrating, and click **Capture** in the viser GUI. This writes `calibration_files/<serial>/{color.png,depth.npz}` per camera and `calibration_files/robot_pcd.npz` (the robot mesh point cloud at that pose).
3. **Segment the robot** in each `calibration_files/<serial>/color.png` and save the result as `calibration_files/<serial>/mask.png` in the same directory — `icp.py` reads its **alpha channel** as the mask (opaque = robot, transparent = background) and zeroes out depth outside it before aligning. We use [Segment Anything (web)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/segment-anything-web): upload `color.png`, click on the robot to select it, and export/download the cutout as `mask.png` — its default transparent-background export already matches the alpha convention `icp.py` expects. A camera without a `mask.png` is skipped (see `discover_calibration_serials`, which requires both `depth.npz` and `mask.png`).
4. From the same directory (containing `calibration_files/`, `extrinsic_calibration.json`, `intrinsic_calibration.json`), run:
   ```bash
   python -m lerobot_3d.icp
   ```
5. For each camera, the viser GUI shows translate/rotate buttons (±X/±Y/±Z), a step-size cycle button, reset, confirm, and abort — nudge the point cloud onto the robot mesh, then **Confirm**. ICP then refines the confirmed pose automatically and shows the result for a second confirm/abort.
6. The refined `extrinsic_calibration.json` is written back — ready for `lerobot-teleop`.

## Custom teleop script

Build a **`TeleopSystemConfig`** (`lerobot_3d.teleop_config`) with **`SO101AxisConfig`** entries for each **leader** and **follower** (`port` + LeRobot `id`), **`realsense_serials`**, and any optional fields you need (`urdf_path`, `robot_calibration_ids`, `camera_width`, `camera_height`, `camera_fps`, `tune`, `viser_port`). `len(leaders)` must equal `len(followers)`. `robot_calibration_ids` defaults to each follower's `id`; the **first** follower's observation drives the mesh/point-cloud visualization returned as `robot_pcd`/`robot_link_pcds`.

Call `step()` each tick for `datapoints` (raw per-camera color/depth), `scene_pcd` (Open3D point cloud — `np.asarray(scene_pcd.points)`/`.colors`), `robot_pcd` (`(M, 3)` `float64`), and `robot_link_pcds` (`dict[str, np.ndarray]` keyed by URDF link name). Call `close()` when `system.viewer.quit` is set:

```python
import time

from lerobot_3d.control.teleop import TeleopPointCloudSystem
from lerobot_3d.teleop_config import load_teleop_system_config

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hz = 15.0
    period_s = None if hz <= 0 else 1.0 / hz

    config = load_teleop_system_config("./my_teleop_config.yaml")

    system = TeleopPointCloudSystem(config)
    system.connect()
    try:
        while not system.viewer.quit:
            t0 = time.monotonic()
            datapoints, scene_pcd, robot_pcd, robot_link_pcds = system.step()
            # use datapoints / scene_pcd / robot_pcd / robot_link_pcds here
            if period_s is not None:
                time.sleep(max(0.0, period_s - (time.monotonic() - t0)))
    finally:
        system.close()
```

`step()` also takes an optional `masks_by_serial` (a `{serial: mask}` dict or a list aligned with `realsense_serials`; nonzero/`True` pixels are kept) to mask the fused point cloud per camera.

For a fully custom stack (different robot type, no `TeleopPointCloudSystem`), build directly on **`SO101Leader`**/**`SO101Follower`** from LeRobot and **`SystemStateViewer`** in `lerobot_3d.point_clouds.system_vis`, passing a `TeleopSystemConfig` and calling `update(*actions)` with one dict per follower each tick.
